## Wilson's Tasklist

1. Determine source of lag coming from pause and attempt to fix it.
2. Implement skip intro
  - Show a skip button that only exists at least 5 seconds before the first note spawns
  - If the button is pressed, subtract time from all the timers (equal to 5 seconds left before first note is supposed to be hit
  - Else, remove the skip button and continue song normally
3. Implement restart
  - Remake the canvas and reset everything
4. Hit Effects
