### Pauses

[ignoreGlobalPause](https://createjs.com/docs/tweenjs/classes/AbstractTween.html#property_ignoreGlobalPause) Boolean

Causes this tween to continue playing when a global pause is active. For example, if TweenJS is using Ticker, then setting this to false (the default) will cause this tween to be paused when Ticker.paused is set to true. See the tick method for more info. Can be set via the props parameter.

Default: false
